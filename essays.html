Here are some fun things that I've written before. I'm not a particularly vivid writer, but I think writing is supposed to be good for the soul.<br/>

<h3>The Trek</h3>
<em>Aug 2017</em>
<br/>
A lost young man wanders through a big city.
<hr/>
<small>
The bus dropped me off mid-Manhattan at midnight, and I had to get back to that Brooklyn apartment. Already, my mind was already drifting in and out of consciousness, relentlessly attacked by fragmented shards of painful thoughts. I was exhausted -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- and wanted to just lay down and fall asleep. But I had to get back. I wandered through hazy midtown streets, weaving my way through faceless crowds of false cheers, bouncing around like a pinball to the ebb and flow of electric traffic signals, counting the street numbers one by one by one and gradually losing count, losing my awareness, losing myself in an uncountable mass of intoxicated people on the streets of the city that never sleeps. The smell of halal food filled my ears as bits and pieces of conversations floated past my nose, reminding me of lives I'd never encounter again, of apartments I've never rented or of parties I've never attended; all the while, an impending doom and gloom slowly pulled its covers over my soul, over a heart too tired to think, a mind too broken to feel ... I glanced at a grimy window on a nearby empty building, and saw the reflection of a young man who had given up all hope, a scholar who lost his books, a musician who had broken his instrument, a miserable soul lost in the streets of New York City, alone and preoccupied with his incoherent thoughts. Soon, this desolate young man found himself sitting by himself in the rear car of a subway, struggling to keep himself awake while a heartless disembodied voice proclaimed his inner thoughts for all to hear: "Dekalb avenue"... "stand clear of the closing doors" ... "please watch your belongings" ... drifting in and out of awareness, trapped in a stifled delirium filled with strange thoughts and strange odors and strange textures. Soon he'd return to his lodging -- his musty, lifeless, nightmare-inducing room in a beat-up, run-down part of town -- to collapse onto rented bedsheets. This was the Stanford scholar, the proud son, the joyous scientist, the eccentric musician -- helplessly pulled through a hole in the ground, surrounded by strangers in a strange land, on a midsummer night's misery.

<h3>Free Write I</h3>
<em>Jul 2017</em>
<br/>
A spontaneous blob about creativity and the nature of human thought.
<hr/>
<small>
    Thoughts come to my mind, washing in and out of awareness like waves on a beach. I try to write them down, without judgement, saving my ethereal thoughts onto virtual paper for the rest of eternity. I don't know what I'm trying to say. I mean, free writing doesn't sound like it's fun to read in any way. It's not planned out beforehand, so any meaningful conclusions behind the writing are pure coincidence; you don't get to plan out the order ideas come in, so the reader probably just ends up super confused; and you can't put much thought into how you phrase things, because you just type up whatever comes to your head in your natural voice. Nothing's going to end up making any sense. Maybe the point of the exercise is to practice carelessly writing without constantly going back and revising, so thoughts can flow.<br/><br/>

    Human thought really is super duper jumbled: it's a wonder how we manage to organize anything into lectures that make sense, or essays that draw you in, or code that compiles. I mean, as a computational model, I doubt we're like a modern computer processor, processing micro-ops sequentially after another. It seems like our entire brain thinks at the same time, somehow connecting thoughts with other ideas we have, with smells we've deeply related to, with memories we cherish, with anything and everything remotely related -- all with little conscious effort. I think the most accurate reflection of human cognition I've seen was a few years back, in Ms. McCown's literature class: a giant, tangled web of related profound ideas scribbled over an entire classroom wall's worth of whiteboards. Independently, the words held little meaning of its own, but in the context of the fascinating discussion we had, it summed up pretty well all the complex interrelationships between our ideas.<br/><br/>

    So I wonder why we still explain most things in a linear, step-by-step way, when it seems like our deepest understanding of knowledge, our natural representation of thought, is an intimate, intertwined web of ideas. I guess I'm thinking more in context of scientific ideas and how they relate to each other, such as the abstract mathematics of point groups, to the wonderfully clear-cut linear algebra of quantum mechanics, to physical properties of molecules when you shine light on them. This kind of deep, magical relationship is rarely explicitly written in a science textbook -- instead, the textbooks state logical facts, one by one. Interrelationships that elucidate understanding and give aesthetic closure are kind of left as an exercise to the reader. Well, I guess this is specific to science writing. It seems like in the humanities, people aren't afraid to have a more flowery, less logically narrow-ended prose to express the ideas as they truly coagulate in their heads.<br/><br/>

    It's really quite remarkable that we can hold so many unrelated thoughts in our head at the same time; that when our minds naturally wander and we brainstorm things, that nothing quite follows from the other, and ideas just spring about. I guess this is where creativity stems from. Nobody really knows. It's quite magical. The two most creative moments I've ever had didn't happen when I was explicitly, logically, thinking of ideas. The thoughts just spontaneously appeared.<br/><br/>

    For a brief period earlier this summer, I spent my days at home learning physical chemistry to occupy my mind for half the day, and falling victim to my laptop's internet connection for the other half. One morning, my very first moments of consciousness involved a melody in my head -- but I didn't hear it pass through time; I heard the entire 24 or 32 bars at the same time, kind of like looking at a table top-down instead of from the edge. It was a very peculiar feeling -- lying there half-awake, half-asleep, not knowing what world I lived in, experiencing a tune that's likely never existed before that surfaced in my thoughts. I quickly ran over to the piano, still yawning, turned on the voice recorder on my phone, and stashed the melody away to electronic eternity. I don't know what could really explain this kind of mystical moment, apart from the sheer wonder of the human brain.<br/><br/>

    The other moment of magic I've experienced follows as a result of this melody. One night, I found myself unable to fall asleep, so my half-conscious mind started wandering. I must have been thinking about stuff, but I really don't remember what thoughts flowed through my mind -- I was, after all, half asleep. Again, spontaneously, a thought entered my head, and this time it was a poetic title for the song I was trying to write -- "Endless Daydream". But I wasn't purposefully trying to think of anything! I mean, at the time, there must have been a reason why I thought that, but I was so tired I don't remember, and I fell asleep pretty soon in any case.<br/><br/>

    So in both these cases of "sheer genius" or whatever you could call it, I really wasn't paying much conscious attention to my thoughts, and some marvelous ideas just kind of surfaced. It's wonderfully counter-intuitive. Maybe that's why I kept on facing writer's block earlier while trying to write that melody: I must have been trying too hard. In any case, something mysterious about the human subconscious gives rise to inexplicable strokes of creativity. I wish I knew what it was.<br/>

<h3>Phonons?</h3>
<em>Jul 2017</em>
<br/>
A silly short story about phonons.
<hr/>
<small>
    What the hell is a phonon? I know that word from science bowl -- the high school trivia competition that fostered my deep love for science -- but I know absolutely nothing else about that word. Well, I know when "phonon" is the right answer to a question -- I've programmed those reflexes into my right thumb long ago -- but apart from some mumbo-jumbo about "quanta of sound" or "quasiparticle", I've really got no idea what phonons are.<br/><br/>

    It's kind of funny, really. Throughout my golden, carefree time in high school, my science bowl teammates have taught me all sorts of silly science words like "phonon" or "allele" or "colloid". I've developed this kind of uncanny scientific intuition about what term I should spit out of my mouth (read: mad guessing skills). But after these years of competition, all I've learned was the words -- not the vast landscape of science behind them. I've fooled myself into believing that I knew science, when all I knew was how to earn points for the team.<br/><br/>

    But that couldn't have been the only thing I've learned -- no, my science bowl experience taught me a bunch of other invaluable skills. As a team, we got glimpses of deep interrelations between scientific concepts; we could fuse our minds together for 20-second bouts of intellectual judo; our collective intuition, problem-solving apt, and vast (but shallow) banks of knowledge gave us the confidence to tackle any science problem that dared challenge us. Surely, somewhere out there in a musty corner of a teammate's head was a clue to the problem; somehow we would piece together all the parts. We could figure out anything -- together. Because we were scientists.<br/><br/>

    ***<br/><br/>

    A month ago, during a cool summer evening, I was leisurely strolling back from rehearsal with my good friend Scott. The idyllic sounds of Beethoven's Pastorale still rang in our ears, bringing a slight smile to our lips as we chatted about the science of crystal lattices. Scott had spent the last year (trying to) grow some crystals in a solid-state physics lab. We were enjoying the evening, sharing physics with each other, when Scott said a word that suddenly made my eyes grow wide: "phonon".<br/><br/>

    Immediately, I drowned him in a waterfall of questions about phonons. What were they? How do they relate to photons? Why do we care about them? What particle statistics do they obey and why (ie, were they bosons or fermions)? Why can we think of them as particles -- and why is it useful to do that? And on and on and on...<br/><br/>

    And so Scott tried his best to satisfy my never-ending stream of questions. As the sun slowly faded away, our silhouettes stood outside my dorm and ideas as beautiful as the Beethoven bounced between our minds. Particularly intriguing to me was why Scott kept talking about phonons in terms of their wavenumber <code>k (k=2&pi;/&lambda;</code> where <code>&lambda;</code> is wavelength), as if phonons were waves in space! It seemed more natural to me to describe them by their (angular) frequency <code>&omega;</code>, since he told me that phonons were vibrations of the crystal lattice, and each normal mode --- each particular way the nuclei would shake -- has a definitive, characteristic frequency. So why <code>k</code>? The secret, he revealed, was that phonons had a so-called "dispersion relation" <code>&omega;(k)</code> relating frequency to wavenumber, and in fact it was nicer to label them by wavenumber. I wanted to know more -- but it was getting late, so we said our goodbyes.<br/><br/>

    When I got back to my room, I guess I could say more about phonons: they were quanta of the vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, they behave like bosons, and you can create and annihilate them with the raising and lowering operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator. But I still felt like I knew nothing. Scott did leave one tantalizing hint, though, for how a phonon's wavenumber <code>k</code> related to its frequency <code>&omega;</code>: it came from figuring out the eigenvalues to some matrix that I'd encounter while solving for the vibrational modes. Spiffy...<br/><br/>

    ***<br/><br/>

    I was a scientist, right? I could figure out that dispersion relation if I put my heart to it -- yes, I must have it in me. One day, I vowed, I would arm myself with a G2 pen, decorate some blank paper with charming calculations, and end up with a beautiful formula about phonons. I had to prove myself that my experiences in science bowl weren't completely useless; that even if I knew nothing about phonons, I could figure stuff out. I wanted to prove to myself that I was a real scientist.<br/>

<h3>General Relativity, Curvature, and Popular Science</h3>
<em>Jun 2017</em>
<br/>
A little motivation and summary about an article  that I wrote for my freshman year writing class.  Read the <a href="files/rba.pdf">full article</a> if you're interested!
<hr/>
<small>
Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) is a uniquely fascinating scientific theory -- it is both technically profound and culturally impactful. In fact, growing up in today's world, I learned from that black holes warp the fabric of spacetime long before I formally learned any differential geometry from textbooks! Clearly the discourse between "science" and "popular culture" (loosely defined) has got to be some kind of two-way street...<br/><br/>

At the end of my freshman year, I got very interested in how popular culture affects science. Specifically, did Einstein's celebrity status in the 20's and 30's influence the way scientists talked about curvature in GR? I discovered that early writings on GR used a very literal, dry mathematical description of curvature, where words such as "flat" and "curved" were just meant to be taken as metaphors. But modern writings endow spacetime with a <em>physical</em> curvature. Interesting! Perhaps this shift arose from how newspapers and other media sources explain GR to laypeople...<br/>
