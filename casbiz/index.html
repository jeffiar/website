We have played for the Stanford Atheltics Board, the Stanford Dept. of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford Alumni Reunions, and more.<br/><br/>

Our rates are <b>$300 per hour</b> -- a student-group rate for a professional-group quality. For performance requests, please contact at <code>jeffjar (snail) stanford.edu</code> .
