<h3>Fluorescent Protein Photophysics</h3>
<i>Jan 2018 - Aug 2019</i><br/>
<hr>
In the <a target="_blank" href="https://boxerlab.stanford.edu">Boxer lab</a>, I have embarked on a crystallographic journey to uncover some photophysics of fluorescent proteins.<br/><br/>
<h4>About fluorescent proteins</h4>
<div class="left_image"><img src="img/betabarrel.png" width="150px"></div>
Many years ago, scientists discovered the first fluorescent proteins in glowing jellyfish, and since then, people have created all sorts of variations of fluorescent proteins for cellular imaging. The particular type of fluorescent protein that I study is called a <b>photoswitchable</b> fluorescent protein that behaves like a togglable light-bulb. When you shine a blue 488nm laser on the protein, it stops fluorescing and becomes dark, and when you shine a purple 405nm laser on it, it starts fluorescing again. By exploiting this photoswitching property in clever ways, you can take better pictures of cells (known as <b>super-resolution microscopy</b>). But to design better photoswitching proteins, it's helpful to have some sense of the physical principles behind their function.<br/><br/>

<h4>Elucidating photo-isomerization</h4>
In my project, I wanted to understand the mechanism of the photoswitching process. We know that the on-to-off behavior occurs because the light-emitting part of the protein (known as the <b>chromophore</b>) changes shape from <i>cis</i> to <i>trans</i> when it absorbs a photon of light. But we didn't know the <i>exact trajectory</i> of the atoms as they rearrange from a cis conformation to a trans conformation. So we wanted to elucidate (pun intended) the photo-isomerization mechanism of these photoswitching proteins.<br/><br/>
<h4>An unexpected discovery</h4>

As part of my research, I crystallized these fluorescent proteins to determine their structure via X-ray diffraction. On the left, I've shown the mesmerizing structure of crystalline protein. You can see the protein units closely packed against each other in a regular, repeating lattice. As you'd imagine, such a closely packed environment is quite different than the typical biological environment for a protein.<br/><br/>

While solving crystal structures, I made the surprising discovery that the internal chromophore pocket of the protein could be perturbed by the packing interactions between the protein units of the crystal. This sort of finding makes you really question whether crystal structures of proteins reflect their structures in vivo!<br/><br/>

Keep an eye out for a publication later this year, where I will report my fascinating finding in more detail.<br/>

<b>Update Aug 2019:</b> A preprint is now available <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Structural_Evidence_of_Photoisomerization_Pathways_in_Fluorescent_Proteins/9209450">here</a>, hooray!
