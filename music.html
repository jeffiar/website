<h1>Music<img src="img/piano.gif" alt="A cartoon of piano keys"></h1>

<p>In October of 2022, I had a fun piano/melodica recital called "Bach and More!" It was in the atrium of a beautiful modern biology research in the Harvard Cambridge Campus. The turnout was surpringly large and we had a fun and wholesome time. You can even hear the jingling of a dog collar in the front row. A recording of the livestream is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6TIqZsMfRI" target="_blank">here</a>. I also wrote up some <a href="files/bach-and-more-program.pdf">program notes (pdf!)</a>. Fun fact: I tried to put into practice some principles of <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/" target="_blank">Practical Typography</a> which I found online the month before.</p>

<p>These days I also play in a jazz quartet called Mutual Beef. You can find us at.... <a href="https://mutualbeef.com" target="_blank">mutualbeef.com</a>.

<h2>College years</h2>

<p>Click the picture below to check out my senior recital from May 2020! It includes Bach, Brahms, Ravel, and Chopin. <img src="img/iconsmile.gif" alt="Smiley face"></p>

<p>Also, please enjoy this high-quality recording of <i>Oiseaux Tristes</i> from Ravel's <i>Miroirs</i> Suite (thank you, Taide!) This was recorded on May 18, 2019 at the Stanford Department of Music Awards Concert.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ymp8Hshkkg" target="_blank">here</a> is a very energetic performance of Gaubert's Trois Aquarelles with my fellow SCOr musicians Papa Odita-Honna (flute) and Michael Chung (cello). <a href="https://scor.stanford.edu" target="_blank">SCOr</a> is a marvelous conductorless, democratic chamber orchestra that I had the pleasure to be a part of from 2016 to 2020. </p>
