<h1>Statistical Mechanics</h1>
A cell is made of lots of atoms moving around, so before learning about biology, we ought to learn about the physics of many-body systems.  
<br/><br/>
The language of <b>statistical mechanics</b> describes the <i>collective behavior</i> of many interacting atoms. It helps us answer questions such as:
<ul>
<li> Of all the copies of protein ABC in a cell, what fraction are in an active conformation vs an inactive conformation?</li>
<li> What does it mean for a protein to "bind tightly" to something? <small>For instance, antibodies from our immune system need to recognize and stick to "bad guys", transcription factors need to bind to genes to turn them on and off, etc.</small></li>
<li> How long does it take for a metabolite to diffuse from one end of a cell to another?</li>
<li> Why (and how!?) do our cells maintain differing concentrations of ions and metabolites on different sides of a membrane?</li>
<li> How do our cells drive chemical reactions that <i>cost</i> energy to perform?</li>
</ul>
As we'll see, the main idea behind stat mech is that when many atoms interact together, most of the atomic details end up becoming irrelevant. The collective behavior is instead summarized by a few "thermodynamic variables" that control biological behavior, such as the temperature and the chemical potential. Since there's <i>so many</i> atoms jiggling around and trading energy with each other, we can describe their behavior statistically; even though the motion of <i>individual</i> atoms appears random, the overall macroscopic behavior is essentially deterministic, and is described by these thermodynamic variables.
<br/><br/>
Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework to understand the <i>driving forces</i> behind cellular behavior. It tells us why certain processes are favorable and others are not. In the subsections below, we'll learn how to think about protein-protein binding, the energetics (and "entropics") of concentration gradients, diffusion, and more.
