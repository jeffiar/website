    <dd>An interesting experiment from the 2018 holiday season. I bit off way more than I could chew. Turns out the best way to learn to swim is not to jump into the deep end of the pool!</dd>

<h2 id="papers">Interesting Final Papers</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="files/simulating-ideal-gas.pdf">Simulating an Ideal Gas to Verify Statistical Mechanics</a> (pdf!)</dt>
    <dd>It's rather remarkable that the properties of a gas can arise from the "kinetic theory" of a bunch of billiard balls bouncing around. I wrote a little molecular dynamics engine to simulate such motion, and I got a hands-on experience of the tenets of statistical mechanics such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. Here's the report I wrote for my computational physics class.</dd>
    <dt><a href="files/rba.pdf">The Evolution of General Relativity through the Lens of Curvature</a> (pdf!)</dt>
    <dd>Nowadays, scientists talk about Einstein's magnificent theory using words such as "curvature" and "warping the fabric of spacetime"&mdash;but a century ago when Einstein first came up with the theory, the language was completely different. At the end of my freshman year, I was curious whether the curvature meteaphor arose from scientists trying to explain the theory to the general public. Here's the research-based argument I wrote for my writing and rhetoric class.</dd>
    <dt><a href="files/circle-decoherence.pdf">Quantum Decoherence of a Particle on a Circle</a> (pdf!)</dt>
    <dd>At her smallest level, Nature obeys the mystifying and conterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics, yet somehow, in our day-to-day lives, we see a completely different classical world filled with pocketwatches and saucers rather than wavefunctions and superpositions. The theory of decoherence explains how (aspects of) our familiar classical world emerges from the underlying quantum mechanics. In my final project for a grad quantum class, I explored the decoherence of spinning objects (since most other texts only talked about sliding objects!). Notice a common pattern, an obsession with emergence??</dd>
