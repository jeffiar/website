<h3>Interactive Applets for understanding phase transitions</h3>
<em>Februrary 2019</em><br/>
<div class="right_image"><a href="statmech2/fun.html"><img src="img/landau-free-energy.PNG" width="200px"></a></div>
When we were learning about phase transitions in my statistical mechanics class, I thought it would be fun to get a better grasp of the Landau Free Energy by getting my hands dirty and fiddling around with the model parameters. So I made some interactive javascript applets to help explain the physics.<br/><br/>

<h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
<em>January 2019</em><br/>
In winter of 2019, I decided to write up <a href="statmech2/index.html">lecture</a> <a href="fourier/index.html">notes</a> for my classes, where I explained physics/math concepts with a characteristic personal touch. My classmates really enjoyed my notes, and a lot of people ended up reading them. <br/><br/>

<a href="statmech2/index.html"><img src="biochem/img/book.gif"></a> My notes for Physics 171 (Statistical Mechanics II) can be found <a href="statmech2/index.html">here</a>. They're very detailed and elucidating, and I'm rather proud of them. Hopefully one day I'll be able to consolidate them into a more formal resource.<br/><br/>

<a href="fourier/index.html"><img src="biochem/img/book.gif"></a> My notes for EE 261 on Fourier Transforms can be found <a href="fourier/index.html">here</a>. I abandoned these notes after a while, since I was getting much more out of writing the statistical mechanics notes.

<h3>Impatient IMSLP</h3>
<em>September 2018</em><br/>
Classical musicians from all around the world are familiar with the <a href="https://imslp.org/">IMSLP</a>, a website where you can download lots of publically available sheet music. Unfortunately, if you don't pay for their subscription, you have to wait 15 seconds to download music. So I wrote a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imslp-impatience/emdlcbabhommgkpbobhamnjppplhpgbj">simple Chrome extension</a> that skips the 15-second waiting period.

<h3>Ideal Gas Simulations</h3>
<em>June 2018</em><br/>
For the longest time I was confused and amazed by the simplest results of statistical mechanics. Somehow, the macroscopic behavior of a gas could be explained from the details of little particles whizzing around, but even after seeing the equations, I was still somewhat unsettled. So to properly convince myself, I coded up a little python engine to simulate a hard-sphere classical ideal gas.

If you want to read up on the details, I wrote up a <a href="files/simulating-ideal-gas.pdf">nice and detailed report</a> for my computational physics class.<br/>
